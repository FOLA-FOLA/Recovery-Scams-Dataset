AFRICA FINANCIAL WATCHDOG,

SETTLEMENT OF OVERDUE PAYMENT

Attn: Beneficiary,

We are writing to inform you of the new committee setup by the African Union (AU) in conjunction with the office of the AU chairman, about your overdue payment. The group was put in place on financial matters, to see to the complaints of beneficiaries like yours who have been dealing with some insincere government officials in Africa and beyond.

We have received a series of complaints of unclaimed inheritance and contract funds in some banks. Consignments that were supposed to be delivered to the doorsteps of beneficiaries, but due to wrong documentations through the back doors, you could not receive what is rightfully yours.

We are here to resolve these numerous problems facing such claims and make delivery or payment to genuine beneficiaries. But your cooperation will be needed by stopping all your present or past dealings with such people by cooperating with us to get your problems resolved and actualizing your dreams of receiving your fund.

We have gone round all the banks and security companies in Africa and checked with them, we discovered some funds in some banks and consignments that belong to you. If you cooperate with our team of experts, you will get what is rightfully yours.

All we need from you now is to write back to us with genuine proof as the beneficiary, we will proffer our professional advice and make payment to you immediately. We will be waiting for your urgent response and STOP all further transactions with any group or persons. Because we have taken over your transaction to make sure you receive what is rightfully yours.

Yours faithfully,

John Brumme.
(Committee Chairman)
