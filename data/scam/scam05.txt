FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION SEEKING TO WIRETAP THE INTERNET


The Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I) write to you in correspondence to the meeting we recently had with the Federal republic of Nigeria Government on the ERADICATION of SCAMS on the internet. Federal bureau of investigation (FBI) Washington, DC in conjunction with some other relevant Investigation Agencies like Internal Revenue Service here in the United states of America have recently been informed through our Global intelligence monitoring network that you presently have a transaction with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as regards to your over-due contract payment which was fully endorsed in your favor accordingly. After the meeting held on Friday 25th of June 2010 at the Bank Auditorium Center, the whole conflict of SCAMS was revealed to us by the Board of Trustee of Federal Republic of Nigeria mostly by the three arms of Government.

The Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive).

These three arms of Government has made Us realize that the ramped of SCAMS over floating around the United State of America and some other part of the world was been set up by the root of some CBN Ex-Workers that have been suspended for sometimes due to their dubious characters of initiating people to impersonate the Government Workers to receive peoples hard earn money from them, mostly with the Executive Governor identity.

For these reasons, the New Central Bank Executive Governor was invited to this office to defend the allegation against Him. While he made complain that his office was not in charge of foreign transfer of funds, that the accredited office was Federal Ministry of Finance Department (FEDMINAP) in person of EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR: MR. LAMIDO AMINU SANUSI as the New appointed Accountant General in charge of all foreign transfer Payment files.

They also told us that the only problem they are facing right now is that some unscrupulous element are using this project as an avenue to scam innocent people off their hard earned money by impersonating the Executive Governor that is why the Federal Government has appoint EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR: MR. LAMIDO AMINU SANUSI as the Payment Director of the Central Bank office.
The Federal government of Nigeria has approved that all overdue outstanding payments must be paid on or before Monday 25th of June 2010, before the upcoming Local Government Electorates which might leads to recalling of funds back to the Bank Treasury. Meanwhile, we are also informed that a Man with an America passport number (3028882234) came to the Central Bank affiliated bank office in U.K few days ago with a letter, claiming to be your true representative.

Here are the man information below:
