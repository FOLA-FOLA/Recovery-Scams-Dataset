This oppurtunity may not come again.

Dear Sir,
It is glaring that all our efforts in making you take value for your
money for the past one year has not been able to meet you at any
convenient bend simply because you have continually aligned our mails
and efforts to those bucket of fools who has been masquerading to be
of consequence by impersonating known and established authorities.
it remains a considered view of this Commission to reach out to you
directly once more before this fund is retired to the treasury by the
Auditors assuming it to have been abandoned or unclaimed by you which
we will not fail to thank you in advance for your Chivalrous gesture
in dashing this out which goes back to the society to contribute or
fund part of our cooperate social responsibilities.
We seek your support and honest counsel by giving meaningful reasoning
to this mail.
Be advised.
GORDON RICHARD
European Credit Commission
