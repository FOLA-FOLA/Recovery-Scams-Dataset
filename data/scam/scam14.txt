Hello, I came across your post about the Crvpto scam a friend had similar issues went to a specialist for help.
Have vou tried any Cyber Specialist?
I could recommend someone who could provide you assistance without no charges as they're regulated and authorize fraud forensic expert and this all depends on your case. l'Il advise you file a complaints to see if funds are recoverable cause it's indeed a feasible process
I'll advise you file an official complaints with Brucecybercom@protonmail.com
This is just to let vou know funds could be recouped
