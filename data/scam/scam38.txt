Be informed that the Scotland Yard Police, Interpol, Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI) United States of America, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of Nigeria and all the African Crime fighter leaders have come together to stop scam/internet fraud in Nigeria and all-round Africa. We have recovered over US$5.3 Billion Dollars from the people we have behind bars.


Our duty is to make sure we stop Internet scam and money laundering. As for today we have put a lot of fraudsters in jail. We go all over Africa to pick this thieves/Internet rats. We have over 8,273 of them in our jails round Africa and we are still looking for more. We are aware that a lot of foreigners out there have been deceived and lost their hard earn money to these fraudsters after promising them percentages in their letters/e-mails for their impending help to move funds out of Africa including fake lottery winning notification and at the end of the day, they will collect thousands of dollars from you without a successful end.


It was agreed that to retain the good image of Nigeria and the rest of African countries, all the victims who lost his/her hard earn money to these faceless thieves will be compensated with just US$5M (Five Million Dollars Only). This we assume will help you to start a new life.
