Dear Friend

This is Barrister Kevin Peter and i am reaching you in respect to you
none compose acceptance towards your long over due payment,Sir it will
be please to know that as a Lawyer of International Repute and a
Financial lawyer i have been Monitoring your Payment situation and
have noted that you cannot get this money and you have been following
shadow which will have no end until you drop death,You know why
because you are ignorant of the fact that you believe and trusted
Dr.Godwin Emefiele and his CO HOST that have milk so much out of your
pocket to an extend that you are sorry for yourself .Though you cause it
yourself because you so much believe and trusted in their hands.

Based on the fact that you have totally fail yourself by taking the
wrong ways and rout towards your payment i want to state here that an
order of restriction have been giving against you at the International
Financial Fiduciary Court which means that your fund and payment have
been tag none assistance as you cannot do anything about it.

Now Mr.man ask yourself one question,why have it take you so long
after you have paid and paid and nothing good comes out of it and no good
result and no money in your account as you where promised by Dr.Godwin
Emefiele and Co?,Your fund as i speak with you never existed in your name
again as everything about this fund have been change to a Collaborator
of Dr.Godwin Emefiele and CO and whatever step you are taking from this
moment is to assist them to transfer this your money to another person
account and it will be share between the person and Dr Emefiele and
his co- host.

Now you can see that you are the big loser and you will never gain any
profit because you are so naive that you refused to see reason why you
must seek and ask of advice from people like me that have a concern
feeling for your situation.

I hope you will re-dress your step and realize that in totality you
are a loser but first you have to regret your lost and even if you
have to do this with Dr.Emefiele and co for 100 Years the story will still
be the same and nothing good will come to you from these set of peopl
you trusted for
a very long time now.

This is my candid advice to you seek for help so that you get your fund.

Regards

Barrister Peter Kevin
